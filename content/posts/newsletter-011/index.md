Welcome to the eleventh issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup’s
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates
### Animal Chess [https://github.com/netcan/AnimalChess](https://github.com/netcan/AnimalChess)
![AnimalChess](https://github.com/netcan/AnimalChess/raw/master/assets/animal_chess.png)

Pronounced "Doe Show Chee" which means literally, Animal Fight Chess,
This is a popular game in China, especially among children.

It is apparently derived from the very popular Xiangqi — the Chinese form of chess.

Although Dou Shou Qi is not familiar to many in the western world,
it has strong similarities to the game Stratego.

The project use alpha beta pruning algorithm for AI, and provide python module to use
AlphaZero algorithm for training, unfortunately it's restricted by my computing power,
currently doesn't get best model.

#### Goal
To win the game, one player successfully move any animal into
the Den（兽穴）of the opponent or eat all animals of opponent.

The basic move is just one space either forward, backward, left or right.
The pieces never move diagonally.

Each player has eight pieces, different animals, with different degrees of power,
a larger power piece can eats little power piece, but rat can eats elephant.

Here are the pieces, their English names, and their relative powers,
indicated by number:
